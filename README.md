# Battery Charge Notification
A simple python script that raises notifications based on laptop's battery percentage in order to preverse the battery health.

The laptop's battery has the same chemistry as a phone's battery, its Li-ion. It doesn't need full discharging and leaving it at 100% it will also affect its health.

In order to protect the battery, Battery Charge Notification informs you when the set battery percentage matches the lower or higher limit. 
For example when the laptop discharges an the battery percentage is 20% it will let you know that it needs to be plugged in, the other way around if the laptop is charging and the percentage is 80%, it will let you know so you can unplug it.
